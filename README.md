I coded through index, dining and contact page. In the navigation dropdown, index.html is Home, dining.html is Dining, and contact.html is Reservations.
# Dining Page
I wireframed the dining page, protytped it and coded the page based off of it
To create a moving menu within the same page, I used screenshots of the menu I made in the wireframe and changed the image source every time next and previous were clicked on in JavaScript.
# Contact Page
In the contact page, I used Google Maps to find the location of the restort, and copied the iframe from their share button in order to embed Google maps into my page. I then used a form and input box to create directions from the user's input to the location. I hid the resort input field in order for the user to not be able to accidentally set the wrong destination, while letting them input where they want to start.
To create the animations for the submit button, I made the background color fill in the red that is used throughout the website, and set it to fill the background when it is hovered over.
When you click submit for the "Contact us" section, I used the ::after pseudo selector to insert a thumbs up image to show feedback that the information is "sent" and that the user has properly clicked the button.
